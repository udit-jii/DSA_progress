Tracking dsa 


My Leetcode ID = "https://leetcode.com/u/Viperior/"

During my first half I watched 25 lectures of CodeHelp- by babbar, solved various problems he used to do during vid lectures on vs code.

Then to practice more i exercise on leetcode

Till now i have learned about:
arrays
string
binary search 
space time complexity
sorting techniques like bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort
various std libraries like stack, queue, dequeue, set, etc.
2d arrays 
and basic maths for dsa 
bitwise operators like xor and using them in questions like identifying an element with count 1 in an array with all other elements count 2
making star and butterfly patterns
pointers 
pointers in array and functions
Recursion and solving questions related to it
and at last i explored a bit of backtracking although not able to much questions
